<h3>Favorite Movies</h3>
<p>Movies have always played a part in my life-time. I like some movies but there are movies that I completely love.

<!---My favorite TV show part-->
<h2>Favorite TV shows</h2>

<p>Same as movies, TV shows have played a big part in my life. Some of my favorite shows consist of South park, Regular Show, Hey Arnold, and other shows. My favorite animated show is South Park. The show is funny in my opinion and I like the character. But it's not my favorite T.V show of all time. My favorite show of all time as to be Ted Lasso. This show is a good feel show and since I love soccer, that's one of the reason why I love the show.  </p>

<!--My favorite Sports Teams-->

<h2>Favorite Sports Team</h2>



<p>Sports are the best thing created. My favorite sports is soccer and basketball. My favorite Basketball Team is the Los Angeles Lakers. My favorite players in basketball are Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis. Watching the Lakers win the championship in 2020 was the best feeling ever. Soccer is my main sport. I use to play in a team back in the day and I watch a bunch of soccer games and videos. Soccer has brought me happiness and I love it. My favorite soccer team is FC Barcelona. Barcelona is a soccer club in Barcelona, Spain. FC Barcelona means a lot to me because it was the first soccer team I've known. Lionel Messi, the best soccer player of all time, has played for FC Barcelona. Because of him, my love for this soccer team grew 100% percent. Their colors are red and blue and I love that. They look like the Gif below.  </p>
