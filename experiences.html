<h2>Experiences with Web Development</h2>
<p>My experiences with web development is very slim. I have only taken two classes on coding and that's pretty much it. 
    Taking the course as of now, shows me that there is a lot to learn about Web development. HTML so far has been really interesting. I can't wait to learn about the other important parts in creating a website such as CSS and Java Script.
